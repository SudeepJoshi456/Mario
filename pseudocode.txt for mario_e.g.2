EXAMPLE NO.2

This is the another pseudocode on how to make pyramid blocks in mario:

Ask for an integer to represent the width of the pyramid
if the width is less than 1 and more than 8, then ask for another integer
make 8 rows using for loop
inside the first row, make 7 columns of dots and 1 column of hash using for loop
add two dots
after the two dots
make 1 column of hash in the first row 
in every next row, decrease the number of dots' column and increase the number of hashes' column on left side of the two dots; 
similarly, increase the no. of hashes on right side
the two dots should be fixed in the middle
when we reach our intended result, replace the dot with space
Exit

The output you will get from mario_e.g.2 is:
       #  #
      ##  ##
     ###  ###
    ####  ####
   #####  #####
  ######  ######
 #######  #######
########  ########
Here, we have used hashes as the bricks we see while playing mario
